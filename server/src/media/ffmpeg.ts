/**
 * Finding, fetching and running ffmpeg.
 *
 * ffmpeg does every pixel and every sample this app touches: it resizes 1.16 GB
 * of album art down to thumbnails, and it mixes seven stems into a 30-second
 * preview. Using it rather than a native image library is not only about
 * audio — `server/tsup.config.ts` bundles the server to a single ESM file with
 * `noExternal` set to match everything, so a native addon like `sharp` was
 * never an option.
 *
 * ## It is fetched, not bundled
 *
 * Every static Windows ffmpeg build is around 100 MB. Shipping one inside
 * `YASS.exe` would roughly double it, for a feature that degrades gracefully
 * when it is missing. So it is downloaded once, into the app's own directory,
 * verified against a pinned SHA-256, and cached forever. That needs the
 * internet exactly once, at setup — not at party time.
 *
 * Resolution order, cheapest and most explicit first:
 *
 *  1. `YASS_FFMPEG` — an absolute path, for anyone who wants to choose.
 *  2. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\yass\bin\ffmpeg.exe` — what we fetched last time.
 *  3. `PATH` — a system install, which most developers already have.
 *
 * When none resolve, the media features stay dark: `hasArt` and `hasPreview`
 * come back false and the client draws exactly what it drew before any of this
 * existed. Nothing errors, and nothing half-works.
 *
 * ## The fetch is Windows-only, and the rest of this file is not
 *
 * Only step 2 is: the pinned artifact below is a Windows build, and installing
 * it anywhere else would leave a PE executable named `ffmpeg` sitting in the
 * app's own directory, found by step 2 on every subsequent run and failing to
 * execute every time. So `fetchFfmpeg` refuses, and Linux and macOS resolve
 * through `YASS_FFMPEG` or `PATH` — where a package manager has almost
 * certainly already put one, and where the answer is one command rather than a
 * 110 MB download. Everything else here — resolution, running it, the timeout
 * — is the same code on every platform.
