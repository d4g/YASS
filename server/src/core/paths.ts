 * Platform path defaults.

 * YARG writes `currentSong.json` to Unity's `persistentDataPath` (derived from
 * companyName `YARC` / productName `YARG`) plus a build-channel subfolder:
 * `release`, `nightly`, or `dev`.
 *
 * These are defaults only. YARG can be launched with `-persistent-data-path`,
 * which replaces the whole path including the channel — and the YARC Launcher
 * may pass it — so the resolved directory always stays user-configurable.
 *
 * Which is why `findInstalls` at the bottom looks rather than assumes: somebody
 * running both the release and the nightly build has two data directories, and
 * the channel they are on is a fact about `yargDataDir` rather than a setting
 * of its own. Two settings would be two things to disagree.
