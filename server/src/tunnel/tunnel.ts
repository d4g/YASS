/**
 * A Cloudflare quick tunnel to this server, and the key that guards it.
 *
 * The LAN address stops at the edge of the room's Wi-Fi. A quick tunnel —
 * `cloudflared tunnel --url …`, no Cloudflare account — gives the server a
 * public `https://<words>.trycloudflare.com` address, which is what lets a
 * guest on mobile data, or a network with client isolation, reach it at all.
 *
 * ## Public means the key is the whole defence
 *
 * A trycloudflare hostname is unguessable-ish, but it is not a secret: it is
 * printed in logs and resolvable by anyone who sees it once. So the address
 * handed out carries `?key=…`, and `gate.ts` refuses every tunnel request that
 * doesn't present it. The key is made fresh for every run of the server and
 * every time the tunnel is switched on — the quick-tunnel hostname changes on
 * each start anyway, so a stable key would buy nothing but a longer life for a
 * leaked one. Switching the tunnel off and on is how the host revokes a link.
 *
 * ## cloudflared connects to its own listener
 *
 * Not to the LAN port. `index.ts` opens a second, loopback-only listener on an
 * ephemeral port for cloudflared to point at, and everything arriving there is
 * marked as tunnel traffic before the app sees it. Deciding by *which socket*
 * rather than by proxy headers is what makes the gate fail closed: a header
 * can be missing or forged, and the socket cannot.
 *
 * ## What quick tunnels cannot do
 *
 * Cloudflare documents two limits: no Server-Sent Events, and 200 requests in
 * flight. The first is why `/api/events` declines over the tunnel and the
 * client polls instead; the second is a party of phones scrolling covers, and
 * surfaces as the odd missing thumbnail rather than an outage.
 *
 * ## "Connected" is not "reachable"
 *
 * cloudflared reports its connection a few seconds before the hostname exists
 * in DNS. A phone that scans the code in that window gets NXDOMAIN — and the
 * router it asked caches that answer, so the address stays dead on that
 * network long after it came alive. So the code is not shown until Cloudflare's
 * own resolver answers for the name, asked directly rather than through the
 * host's resolver, which would cache the same miss for everyone behind it.
