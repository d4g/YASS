 * "Is this request from the machine running the server?"

 * Configuration is host-only: it exposes absolute filesystem paths (which leak
 * the user's account name) and lets the caller repoint the app. Nobody browsing
 * from a phone should see or change it.
 *
 * The reverse-proxy case is the whole difficulty. A proxy connects over
 * loopback, so remote-address alone reports every LAN visitor as local — it
 * fails *open*, which is the wrong direction. Any sign of a proxy hop therefore
 * counts as remote, even though that also hides settings from a host browsing
 * through its own domain. Losing access on the host is recoverable; exposing
 * configuration to the party is not.
 *
 * The Cloudflare tunnel is the same case without needing the headers: it
 * arrives on its own loopback listener, which marks every request `viaTunnel`
 * before the app sees it. Those are never local, whatever else they claim.
