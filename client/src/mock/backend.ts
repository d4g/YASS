/**
 * The demo's stand-in server, running inside the page.
 *
 * The client talks to exactly four things: `GET /api/songs`, `GET
 * /api/now-playing`, the `GET /api/events` SSE stream, and the art routes. This
 * module answers the first three by replacing `fetch` and `EventSource` on the
 * window, and `lib/api.ts` handles the fourth by pointing at a generated data
 * URI instead of a URL. **Nothing in the app knows the difference**, which is
 * the whole reason it is done at this seam: the demo exercises the real hooks,
 * the real reconnection handling and the real components rather than a second
 * copy of them wired to fixtures.
 *
 * ## Why the now-playing feed moves
 *
 * The banner, the venue wash, the "now playing" row highlight and the route from
 * the banner into a song's details are four features that only exist while YARG
 * is running, so a demo with a dead feed would be a demo missing its top edge.
 * A small state machine plays a song for a while, goes idle for a moment, and
 * moves on — with stage lighting drifting underneath it, which is what the wash
 * in `features/nowPlaying/venueWash.ts` is reading.
 *
 * The sequence is fixed, not random, for the same reason the library is seeded:
 * two people looking at the demo side by side should see the same thing.
