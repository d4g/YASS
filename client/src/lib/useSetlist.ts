/**
 * YARG's setlist, over the shared server event stream.

 * every consumer has to treat the unavailable state as the normal one and draw
 * nothing for it.
 *
 * No polling fallback, unlike now-playing: this is a nicety layered onto the
 * banner, and while the stream is down the banner already says so.
