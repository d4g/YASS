 * The single connection to the server's event stream.
 *
 * Several hooks need server pushes — now-playing, the song library, the venue
 * lighting — and a phone on LAN Wi-Fi should not hold a long-lived socket per
 * topic. This module owns one `EventSource` and fans it out, opening on the
 * first subscriber and closing after the last one leaves.
 *
 * `EventSource` reconnects on its own, which is most of why the stream is SSE.
 * The polling fallback in `useNowPlaying` exists for the case where the stream
 * can't be established at all — a proxy that strips `text/event-stream`, say,
 * or the Cloudflare tunnel, where the server declines it on purpose (see
 * `/api/events`). Declined is a different state from dropped: nothing is
 * wrong, the page just learns about songs by asking.
