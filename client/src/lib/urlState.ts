/**
 * The whole view, in the address bar.
 *
 * Everything a person builds up in this app — a search, every filter dimension,
 * a sort, a difficulty lens, the song they are looking at — used to live only in
 * React state, which meant it survived nothing. A refresh lost it. A phone lock
 * that evicted the tab lost it. Handing your phone to the person next to you so
 * they could see what you had found lost it, which is the one that matters,
 * because handing your phone to somebody is the entire social mechanic of a
 * room picking a song.
 *
 * The query string fixes all four at once and adds the thing none of them asked
 * for: the view becomes a link. "Everything under five minutes we can all play"
 * is now something you can send to four phones instead of describing across a
 * room.
 *
 * **Written with `replaceState`, never `pushState`.** The URL is a description
 * of where you are, not a trail of how you got here. Pushing would put an entry
 * in the history for every chip tapped and every arrow-key step through the
 * list, and turn Back — the hardware button on every Android phone in the room —
 * into a control that undoes one letter of a search. Back therefore leaves the
 * app rather than unwinding a filter; Escape is the undo, and it already unwinds
 * one layer at a time.
 *
 * `popstate` is still handled, because a real navigation (opening a shared link
 * from within the same tab, or Back arriving from somewhere else) has to be read
 * back rather than ignored.
 *
 * Decoding is total and never throws. A hand-edited URL, a link from an older
 * build, a value the CSV no longer contains: each unknown piece is dropped and
 * the rest is kept. A shared link that half-works beats an error screen at a
 * party, and a filter naming a genre nobody has simply matches nothing, which is
 * a result the UI already renders.
