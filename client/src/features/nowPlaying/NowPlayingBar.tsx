/**
 * The now-playing banner.
 *
 * Follows the design system's "Currently Playing" language: album art under a
 * double scrim (one vertical, one horizontal) so text stays legible against any
 * artwork, over the card surface.
 *
 * **The banner is a fixed height in every state.** Songs start and stop while
 * people are mid-scroll, and a banner that grows or shrinks on each transition
 * shoves the list under their finger. The idle state fills the same box rather
 * than collapsing.
 *
 * **On a short screen it is one line instead of three.** 92px is a quarter of a
 * phone held sideways, spent on the one song nobody is choosing — the whole
 * point of the surface behind it is the four thousand you might. So `short`
 * collapses the stack into a row: a 32px cover, the badges, the title and the
 * artist on one baseline, the length at the far end. It still says what is
 * playing and still opens its details; it costs 48px to do it. The venue wash
 * survives at full strength, because that is the thing tying the phone in
 * somebody's hand to the screen across the room.
