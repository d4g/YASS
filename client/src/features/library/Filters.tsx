/**
 * Search, sort and filter controls.
 *
 * One component, two placements. On a desktop this is a toolbar under the
 * header, which is where a mouse expects it. In the `bar-stack` mode — narrow
 * *and* tall, which is a phone held upright — the whole cluster moves to the
 * bottom of the screen with `order-last`, because the top 200px of a phone held
 * one-handed is the part a thumb can't reach, and this app is read by guests
 * standing up, on their own phones, mid-party.
 *
 * **`and tall` is the load-bearing half of that.** The thumb argument is an
 * argument about a phone held *upright*: sideways it is a two-handed device
 * whose reachable edges are the left and the right, and the bottom of the
 * screen is where the landscape software keyboard lands — so a search field
 * parked there disappears under the keyboard the moment it is focused. A
 * landscape phone therefore takes the toolbar row, which is also the shape that
 * fits: 844px of width holds the search, the shuffle, both sheet buttons and
 * the count on one line at 54px, where stacking them costs 130. See the
 * variants in `index.css`.
 *
 * Two consequences of the bottom placement, both deliberate:
 *
 *   - **The DOM order doesn't change.** Controls still precede results, which
 *     is the sequence a screen reader and a keyboard want. Only the visual
 *     position flips, via `order-last` and per-child `order-*`.
 *   - **The expanded panel overlays the list rather than displacing it.** As a
 *     flex sibling it took 459px and squeezed the list to two visible rows; as
 *     an overlay the list keeps its full height and simply sits behind. You can
 *     still watch rows and the count respond while you narrow.
 *
 * Sorting is here too, but only while the table header isn't showing. That is a
 * *container* query, not a viewport one: the list shares the window with the
 * detail pane from `lg` up, so a 1024px desktop leaves it 696px — narrow enough
 * that the table header is gone. Asking the viewport would have hidden these
 * chips at exactly the width where they became the only sort control on screen,
 * which is how the app lost sorting on phones the first time.
 *
 * ## Every dimension is a set
 *
 * The panel used to hold three single-select dropdowns and two numeric ones,
 * which could express "songs from Rock Band 3" and never "songs from any Rock
 * Band game" — and the second is the question. Nobody standing in a room asks
 * for one decade; they ask for the eighties and the nineties. Nobody asks for
 * one source; they ask for the stuff everybody knows.
 *
 * So every dimension is a multi-select, and the reading is the one everybody
 * already has from every shopping site they have ever used: **within a
 * dimension, any; across dimensions, all.** `filtering.ts` documents the single
 * exception, which is parts.
 *
 * Multi-select is only affordable because of the token row above the panel.
 * Eight decades and six sources is a reasonable thing to have set and an
 * unreasonable thing to reconstruct from a badge reading `4` — so the state
 * comes out of the sheet and sits in the bar, named and individually
 * removable, where it stays legible with the panel shut. See `filterTokens.ts`.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of dimension, two kinds of control
 *
 * Parts, difficulty, vocals, length, decade, age rating and recording are closed
 * sets of at most eight known values, and they are chips: everything visible at
 * once, one tap to add, one tap to remove, no scrolling and no search box for
 * eight things.
 *
 * Source and genre are open sets that run to 27 and 57 in a real library and
 * have no ceiling at all. Those are collapsed pickers with a search field and a
 * scrolling list of rows, because a chip cloud of 57 genres is not a control,
 * it is a wall. They stay collapsed until asked for so the sheet opens at a
 * height a phone can hold.

/**
 * A collapsible region that behaves differently in each layout mode.
 *
 * Where the screen is `roomy` it's an ordinary block in the toolbar's flow.
 * Anywhere `cramped` it's lifted out of flow and floated against the bar, so
 * opening it costs the song list nothing — the list keeps its full height and
 * scroll position, and the rows behind the sheet stay live while you narrow.
 *
 * **It opens away from the bar, whichever edge the bar is on.** Upward from a
 * bottom bar, downward from a top one. That is one rule and two anchors rather
 * than two behaviours: a sheet always grows into the screen and never off it,
 * and the button that opened it stays put and stays visible with its accent on.
 *
 * The cap is the same idea measured differently at each edge, and the two are
 * not the same expression because the panel is anchored differently. 55vh above
 * a bottom bar leaves the now-playing banner and a few rows showing, and a
 * fraction is the right shape for that: it is a fraction of the screen the
 * panel is *allowed* to cover.
 *
 * Below a top bar the panel is anchored under the chrome and has to stop at the
 * bottom of the screen, so what it can take is a subtraction rather than a
 * fraction — everything left after the 48px banner and the ~69px toolbar. A
 * fraction cannot state that at both ends: 70svh fits inside a 430px Pro Max
 * and hangs 4px off a 375px SE, because the constant above scales with neither.
 * 130px is those two bars plus a little air, and being generous with the air
 * costs nothing on a box that scrolls.
 *
 * `svh` rather than `vh` throughout, because the two differ by the height of a
 * mobile browser's retracting chrome and that is a large fraction of a
 * landscape screen.
 *
 * It scrolls in every mode, not only when cramped. The panel holds nine
 * dimensions rather than five, and in the flow it is a flex sibling of the
 * list — left uncapped, a fully expanded panel would push the rows off the
 * bottom of a laptop screen, which is the same failure the overlay was built
 * to avoid.
