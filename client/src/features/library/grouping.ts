/**
 * Category headers over the sorted list.
 *
 * Four thousand rows scroll past as an undifferentiated stream, and the sort
 * header names the *columns* rather than telling you where in the library you
 * currently are. These break the run into the divisions the sort already
 * implies: one per artist, per album, per source, per genre; one per decade of
 * years; one per leading letter of a title.
 *
 * **A header should not repeat what the row beneath it already says — and how
 * much the row says depends on how wide it is.** Artist is the one key that
 * groups differently at the two widths.
 *
 * The wide row gives the artist a column of its own, so a header naming it
 * divides the table along the axis the sort just ordered it by, and there is
 * vertical room to spend on saying so. The narrow row stacks the artist
 * directly under the title on every row, where the same header is that string
 * twice over, 2.6 rows apart — 1,586 of them across a real 4,168-song library,
 * 16% of the entire scroll height, on the device with the least of it. There it
 * groups by leading letter instead, which is the answer the title sort already
 * gives, for the same reason.
 *
 * **Groups are found by walking the sorted list, never by bucketing it.** The
 * songs arrive in order, so a header goes in wherever consecutive songs stop
 * agreeing — which means the grouping cannot disagree with the ordering, and
 * descending sorts get descending headers for free rather than through a second
 * rule that has to be kept in step with the first.
 *
 * **Every key gets headers, including the ones no column shows.** `charter` was
 * left out once, on the guess that a header per charter would be a header per
 * row. A real 4,231-song library has 64 charters, most of it credited to one of
 * three. And once a list can be sorted by something the table does not draw —
 * charter, subgenre, folder, date added — the headers are the only place the
 * value it was sorted by appears at all, which makes them the proof the order
 * is what it claims.
 *
 * **Length and difficulty are continuous, and are grouped anyway, because YARG
 * has already cut them.** Both were left out on the grounds that a number line
 * has no natural divisions, which is true and was the wrong conclusion: the
 * divisions do not have to be natural, they have to be *the ones the player
 * already knows*. YARG's own filter menu cuts band difficulty into seven named
 * intensities and length into four buckets, and somebody who has picked a song
 * in the game has read both scales. Inventing our own would have been the
 * mistake; borrowing theirs costs nothing and makes the two longest unbroken
 * runs in the library navigable. `lib/format.ts` holds the tables and cites the
 * files they came from.
