/**
 * Everything one chart carries.
 *
 * The list is a scan; this is the answer. It exists because the wire has always
 * carried far more than a row could show — twenty per-instrument difficulties,
 * the charter, the age rating — and on a phone the row shows five fields of it.
 * Selecting a song is how the rest arrives, and it is the same gesture at every
 * width: a pane beside the list on a desktop, a sheet over it on a phone, this
 * component inside both.
 *
 * "Everything one chart carries" is the title of this file and it is no longer
 * literally true: `playlist` and `format` are on the wire and are deliberately
 * not drawn. See the note over the fact grid.
 *
 * **Album art is real for the whole library now.** It used to be real for
 * exactly one song — whichever one YARG was playing — because the CSV export
 * carries no chart paths and `/api/art/current` was the only route that had
 * one. `server/src/media/` rebuilds that missing column out of YARG's own
 * `songcache.bin`, so every song has a location and therefore a cover,
 * including the ones packed inside `.sng` containers and Xbox CON packages.
 *
 * **The plate stays**, and it is still the thing that makes a song with no
 * cover look composed rather than broken: it sets the *album* and the artist as
 * type — the two things a real sleeve says. It was always written as a square
 * image slot standing in for a record it did not have a photograph of yet, and
 * the whole point of composing it that way is that nothing below it moved when
 * the photographs arrived. Nothing did.
 *
 * ## Why this stopped being a spreadsheet
 *
 * Everything under the plate used to be one `<dl>` of nine hairline-ruled rows,
 * label left and value right, and that is a table however it is styled. Band
 * difficulty — the number a band is here to read — carried exactly the weight of
 * `format: Chart folder`. Nine equal rows over 400px is a ledger.
 *
 * It is three groups now, and they are sized by how often somebody wants them:
 *
 *   1. **Who this is** — title, artist, album, and the source badge, which came
 *      up out of row six because it answers "which game is this from" and it is
 *      the one field that is a picture.
 *   2. **What it plays like** — the parts grid with the band tier on its header.
 *      This is the question the surface exists to answer, and it is the only
 *      thing on the page that is drawn rather than set: five instrument glyphs
 *      inside five difficulty rings, and a sixth ring for the band. Everything
 *      above and below it is type, and the group carries exactly one word —
 *      `band` — because that ring is the only one whose subject isn't a picture
 *      of itself.
 *   3. **The six short facts** — year, length, genre, charter, rating, date
 *      added — as label-over-value cells in three columns. `2006` does not
 *      need 380px of ruled row to itself, and putting its label directly above
 *      it rather than 380px to its left is what stopped the eye having to
 *      traverse the gap nine times.
 *
 * **There are no rules left in this component.** The last one fenced off a
 * separate provenance block, and once `playlist` and `format` were cut that
 * block was two rows — a group too small to earn a divider, and the last place
 * on the surface still setting a label left and a value right. Folding its
 * survivors into the fact grid is what finished the job the divider started.

       * about how the file is packaged, which matters to YARG and to nobody
       * standing in a room deciding what to play. `playlist` is a real
       * organising idea, but a row that prints one name is not how it would
       * pay off; sorting by it is, and the list does that now. Both are still
       * on the wire and still in `Song`, so neither costs anything to bring
       * back.
       *
       * **A `recording: Master / Cover version` row.** It answered a question
       * about the artist line eleven rows above it, in YARG's word for the
       * answer. The artist line says it itself now: `as made famous by`.
       *
       * **A `vocal parts` row.** The count is a picture now — the vocals glyph
       * is one microphone, two or three, drawn by `vocalsArt` — so the grid
       * above answers it in the place the eye is already looking. The row also
       * had to be called `vocal parts` rather than `vocals` to keep it apart
       * from the grid's own VOCALS label, which meant the difficulty of the
       * vocal chart: two different answers under one word, forty pixels apart.
       * Both the row and that label are gone. `formatVocalParts` still exists
       * and still says these words, in the accessible name of the glyph.
       *
       * `charted by` last and left-aligned rather than in a ruled block of its
       * own. It is the field that tells two charts of the same song apart —
       * 178 title-and-artist pairs in a real library have more than one — so it

 * cover is a picture of a *record*: it says `Rumours` and `Fleetwood Mac`, and
 * it says the same thing on all eleven of its tracks. Setting the song's own
 * title here made the plate change with every row and printed the title twice
 * inside 400px — the pane's `<h2>` is directly beneath it — which is a third of
 * what the last review meant by "the detail states the same title three times".
 * Naming the album instead makes the stand-in behave the way the real art will:
 * the same square for the same record, and one more fact on screen rather than
 * the same one again.
 *
 * A song with no album falls back to its own title, which is not a compromise —
 * that is a single, and a single's sleeve carries the song's name.
 *
 * `onError` covers the third case: the server said it had art, and then the
 * chart moved or the network share the library lives on dropped between the
 * scan and the request.

         * the other commonest desktop size there is — put it 55px *outside*

         * 34svh alone cleared the parts grid at 768 and left the second row of
         * facts behind the fold. The second term is what the pane leaves over
         * for a cover: 144px of banner and helper bar above and below it, and
         * ~385px of everything under the square, measured, with ~30px of slack

         * ~850px tall — a 208px cover at 768 — and above that 34svh is the
         * smaller and nothing changed. The sum is only true of the pane; each
         * sheet sets its own cap.

         * The 180px floor stops the plate shrinking to the point where the
         * title has to set at its minimum size and wrap five times. It used to
         * be described as the landscape-phone guard, and it was the opposite:
         * 180px of a 390px screen is a plate that had stopped shrinking exactly
         * where it most needed to, and the parts grid paid for it. A short
         * screen turns the pair through ninety degrees instead and passes a
         * flat width in `className` — a thumbnail beside the type rather than a
         * plate above it, which is a different object and wants no floor.
         *
         * **Centred, deliberately.** Once the cap binds, the square is narrower
         * than the column, and aligning it to the start edge with the type
         * beneath it has been tried — `0d28ed6` — and rejected on sight.
