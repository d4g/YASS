/**
 * What is narrowing the list, said out loud, one removable thing at a time.
 *
 * The collapsed panel used to leave a single digit behind it — `3` — as the
 * only trace of which three of nine dimensions had taken four thousand songs
 * down to twelve. A count is the right badge for a button and the wrong answer
 * to "why am I looking at this"; it tells you how much you have forgotten
 * without telling you what.
 *
 * So the state comes out of the panel and sits in the bar, as tokens: every
 * selected value, named in the app's own words, each one removable where it
 * stands. That is what makes multi-select affordable. Eight decades and six
 * sources is a reasonable thing to have set and an unreasonable thing to
 * reconstruct by reopening a sheet and reading six chip rows for the lit ones —
 * and undoing exactly one of them shouldn't cost a trip back into the panel at
 * all.
 *
 * **The lens is a token too, and deliberately not the same kind of token.** It
 * removes no songs, so counting it as a filter would be a lie; leaving it out
 * entirely would be a worse one, because "sorted by drums, showing drums tiers"
 * is the single piece of state most likely to explain a list that looks wrong.
 * It rides along wearing a quieter treatment — a lens, not a filter.
