/**
 * Which columns the table draws, chosen from the table's own corner.
 *
 * **It lives in the one header cell that names no column.** Every row leads
 * with a 48px cover, so the sort header reserves 48px before `title` and leaves
 * it empty — there is no ordering to offer, since sorting by album art is not a
 * thing. That empty square is the exact place a control over *all* the columns
 * belongs: it costs the table no width, it is already aligned to the grid, and
 * a corner cell configuring the header it sits in is a pattern anybody who has
 * used a spreadsheet already knows. Anywhere else in the header would have
 * taken its width out of a column and left the labels no longer naming the
 * things beneath them.
 *
 * It exists only where the table does. Below 672px of list there is no header,
 * no columns, and one mark per row instead — that choice is a `row shows`
 * control in the compact sort panel, which is visible at exactly the widths
 * this is not.
 *
 * Chips rather than a checklist, because the filter panel is already a wall of
 * chips and a column is the same kind of thing: one of a closed set of eight,
 * on or off, everything visible at once, no scrolling and no search box.
 *
 * ## It is also where the sorts without a column live
 *
 * Charter, subgenre and date added have no column, and a column that
 * is switched off takes its header with it. Their chips go here, above the
 * columns, because this corner is already the one control over the whole
 * table, and anywhere else in the header would take width from a label.
 *
 * While one of them is the sort, no header wears an arrow, because none of them
 * is the sort. The arrow moves here instead, beside the corner's own glyph, and
 * the group headers down the list name the value on every run. Clicking any
 * column header goes back to a column sort, as it always has.
