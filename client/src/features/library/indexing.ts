/**
 * The jump index: where the rail can put you, in the order the list is in.
 *
 * A library of four thousand songs has one way through it — the flick — and a
 * flick answers "further down" rather than "at the M's". The category headers
 * in `grouping.ts` already name every division the sort implies; this turns the
 * same divisions into targets, and `IndexRail` draws them down the right edge.
 *
 * **A mark is a header, or a coarsening of several.** Never anything finer.
 * That rule is the whole design. Sorting by artist puts twelve hundred headers
 * in the list and no rail can hold twelve hundred marks, so the rail collapses
 * them to the letter each artist files under — and because a letter's run
 * begins at some artist, and that artist has a header, the jump still lands on
 * a division the list actually draws. A rail with marks *finer* than the
 * headers would name a place and then arrive somewhere unlabelled.
 *
 * **Marks are found by walking the rendered items, never by bucketing them.**
 * Same reason `groupSongs` does it: the items arrive in the order they are
 * drawn, so a mark goes in wherever consecutive songs stop agreeing, and a
 * descending sort produces a descending rail with no second rule to keep in
 * step with the first.
 *
 * Each mark carries two forms of itself, because the rail is 38px wide and most
 * of these names are not. `glyph` is what fits in a slot — a letter, `80s`, a
 * tier numeral, a source's icon. `label` is the whole thing, said by the
 * callout under the finger and by the button's accessible name. The pair is the
 * point: the glyph gets you there, the label teaches you what it meant.
