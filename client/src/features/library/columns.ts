/**
 * Which columns the table draws, and what the phone row puts beside the time.
 *
 * The list used to show everything it had room for, and "room" was the only
 * question ever asked. That is the right rule for a table of four columns and
 * the wrong one for a table of nine: `parts` and `diff` are two of the loudest
 * things on a row — five glyphs and a drawn ring against text — and they were
 * answering a question ("can the four of us play this, and how hard is it")
 * that most of the time nobody had asked yet. They are what the detail pane is
 * for, and the pane is one click away at every width the table exists at.
 *
 * So the defaults below are a considered edit rather than a capacity limit, and
 * because they are a choice rather than a fact they are also reversible: the
 * picker in the header's corner cell turns any of the seven optional columns
 * back on, and the phone's `row shows` control in the sort panel decides which
 * single mark a 60px row can afford.
 *
 * ## Two authorities, and only one of them is the person reading
 *
 * A column is drawn when it is switched on **and** the list is wide enough for
 * it. The preference is a ceiling; `minList` is the floor, and it exists so
 * turning a column on can never push another one out. Each threshold is the
 * width that column needs *with the whole table present*, which is why they do
 * not move when six of nine columns are off — a rule that changed with the
 * enabled set would mean every toggle silently re-laid-out the columns around
 * it.
 *
 * The floor used to be a container query per column (`hidden @6xl/list:flex`)
 * and is now a number this module owns, for three reasons. The header and the
 * row had to repeat the same query in two different display modes and could
 * drift. A CSS-hidden column still builds its DOM, and `parts` alone is five
 * `<img>` elements on every row of a virtualized list. And the picker has to be
 * able to say *why* a column that is switched on is not on screen, which it
 * cannot do if the answer only exists in the stylesheet.
 *
 * ## Persistence
 *
 * `localStorage`, never the URL. The address bar carries the *view* — the
 * search, the filters, the sort, the song — because that is the thing worth
 * handing to somebody else's phone (see `lib/urlState.ts`). Which columns fit
 * is a fact about the screen it is being read on, and sending a desktop's
 * seven-column table to a phone would be sharing the one part of the view that
 * cannot survive the trip.
