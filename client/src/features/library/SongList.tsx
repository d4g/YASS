/**
 * The song list.
 *
 * Row anatomy follows the design system's `LibraryRow`: an 80px row, Barlow
 * title in the chart's own casing, italic cyan artist, and a rounded capsule for
 * the difficulty. The playing row swaps to the cyan fill washed out to card
 * colour and grows a hard white border — the design's signature treatment.
 *
 * Virtualized because the library runs to thousands of rows — and indexed for
 * the same reason. A jump rail runs down the outer edge of the scroller,
 * carrying one mark per division of whatever the list is currently sorted by;
 * `indexing.ts` decides what those divisions are and `IndexRail` draws them.
 * The rail is a sibling column rather than an overlay, so it costs the rows
 * 38px of a phone's width and never covers one.
 *
 * **Every layout decision here is made from the list's own width, never the
 * window's.** The list no longer owns the window: from `lg` up it shares it with
 * the detail pane, so the same 1280px desktop gives it 870px of width, and the
 * same 1600px one gives it 1140px. Asking the viewport how wide the list is
 * would answer a question nobody asked — it would reveal the album column at a
 * viewport width where the column has nowhere to go. The container is declared
 * in `App`; this file measures it.
 *
 * **The one thing width cannot answer is whether the table is worth having.**
 * A phone held sideways is 844px wide and 390px tall, and the width alone said
 * "table": 80px rows behind a 68px header, which on that screen is one song and
 * a bit. The same list as the narrow row is nearly five. So the wide layout
 * needs the height as well as the width, and `SHORT_QUERY` is the second half
 * of the test. It has to be a media query rather than a measurement for the
 * same reason the row height is a number rather than a class — the virtualizer
 * needs to know before there is a layout to measure — and `index.css` carries
 * the matching `has-table` variant so the compact sort chips appear on exactly
 * the screens this takes the header away from.
 *
 * That measurement decides three things, all in JavaScript rather than in CSS.
 * How tall a row is, which it has to — the virtualizer needs a number before
 * anything is laid out. Which of the two rows to build, because building both
 * and hiding one costs a third of the DOM on every row in the list; see
 * `SongRow`. And which columns the wide row has room for, which used to be a
 * container query per column and is now `columns.ts` — a CSS-hidden column
 * still builds its `<img>` elements, the header and the row had to repeat the
 * same query in two different display modes, and neither of them could explain
 * itself to the picker in the header's corner. `sameShape` keeps the cost of
 * measuring continuously down to one render per threshold crossed.
 *
 * Semantically a `list`, not a `grid`, even though the wide layout is a table.
 * The narrow layout is a different shape entirely — title over a metadata line,
 * with columns dropped — and ARIA has no way to change role at a breakpoint. A
 * list of songs is true at every width; a grid would be a lie in the narrow one.

/**
 * A division of the list — an artist, a decade, a letter.
 *
 * Wears the same wash as the sort header above it, because they are the same
 * kind of thing: a band that names what is under it rather than a row you can
 * act on. It is shorter and quieter than that one, which is the difference
 * between naming the whole table and naming the next twelve songs.
 *
 * Set in the value's own casing rather than uppercased like the rest of the
 * display type. `MOTÖRHEAD` would be very much this design system, but the
 * same rule renders the decades as `1980S`, and a header that looks like a
 * typo costs more than the extra shout is worth.
 *
 * ## The break goes above it, and so does the air
 *
 * A header belongs to the songs *underneath* it, and the band used to say the
 * opposite twice over. Rows carry a 1px rule on both edges, so a header with a
 * bottom border of its own sat 2px clear of the group it names and 1px from
 * the group it had just left — the proximity was pointing at the wrong
 * neighbour. Deleting that border is the whole fix: the row above still draws
 * the line that opens the break, and the header now leans into its own songs
 * with nothing between them. It also puts a seam under the sort header, which
 * shares this wash and used to melt into the first category of the list.
 *
 * The vertical space is spent the same way. The band is 46px for a 15px label
 * and the surplus sits above it, so the name reads as the top of what follows
 * rather than as a caption floating in a strip.
 *
 * ## The count
 *
 * Beside the label rather than out at the right edge, where the eye would have
 * to cross the width of the table to find out which name it belonged to.
 * Suppressed at one, since a `1` after a name says only what the single row
 * below it already shows.
 *
 * **It is set the way the toolbar sets its count** — bright number, dim
 * uppercase unit, five pixels apart — because that is this product's way of
 * writing a quantity, and the toolbar's `1,650 SONGS` is on screen directly
 * above the first of these. Two spellings of one idiom, forty pixels apart,
 * is the kind of thing nobody can name and everybody sees.
 *
 * That is also what buys the separation. The name and the count are one
 * phrase, so distance is the wrong tool for keeping them apart; sentence-case
 * 13px sat against the label and read as more of the name. A tracked 11px
 * uppercase caption drops a full step below a 15px extrabold cyan title and
 * can then sit close to it.
 *
 * `--color-content-muted` for the unit and not the toolbar's
 * `--color-count-muted`: that one is drawn for the app surface and measures
 * 4.23:1 on this band, which is lighter. This is 6.18:1.
 *
 * Baselines, not boxes. Three faces meet in this line — Red Hat Display for
 * the name, Inter for the number, Red Hat again for the unit — and centring
 * their boxes puts three different cap heights at three different levels.
 *
 * The band is a thousand pixels wide and the phrase lives in the first
 * hundred and fifty, which leaves the rest of it empty. That emptiness is
 * load-bearing: the wash is what says "division", and a header carrying a
 * rule or a second column out to the right edge starts competing with the
 * table it is dividing. The space above the label is what keeps the corner
 * from reading as crowded.

 * (`song` comes out of a memoized array, `onSelect` out of a `useCallback` in
 * `App`), so the comparison is cheap and it holds: rows re-render when they are
 * genuinely new, not when the page moves under them.
 *
 * **One layout, not both, and only the columns that are on.** The wide and
 * narrow rows are different shapes rather than the same shape reflowed — see
 * `ROW_HEIGHT_WIDE` — and this used to build them both and let a container query
 * hide one. That is ten `<img>` elements and around sixty nodes for a row that
 * shows six images and forty, on a list that mounts a fresh row for every 80px
 * of scroll. The columns went the same way for the same reason: `parts` alone is
 * five images per row, and with it switched off by default a CSS gate would have
 * kept building all five for four thousand rows to show nobody. `narrow` and
 * `columns` come off one measurement of one box, so nothing here can disagree

/**
 * Narrow layout: the cover, then title over a metadata line, then whichever of

 *
 * The cover leads the row rather than sitting in the cluster on the right. It
 * is the one thing on a phone row that is a picture rather than a number, so it
 * reads at a glance from a fixed column down the left edge — where the eye
 * already is when it starts each row — instead of shuffling left and right with
 * the width of the time beside it. The slot holds its 44px whether or not there
 * is art to put in it, so the titles keep one left edge all the way down the
 * list and a library filling in its covers never re-lays out the rows
 * underneath somebody mid-scroll.
 *
 * **It holds the cover and nothing else.** The source icon used to stand in
 * when a song had no art, back when the leading slot was the only place a phone
 * row ever put one. The source has a slot of its own out on the right now, and
 * one that can be switched off — so borrowing this square for it would either
 * say the same thing twice or say a thing somebody had just asked not to see.
 * An empty square is the honest state of a song whose cover has not arrived.
 *
 * **The trailing cluster is a set, and the defaults are an edit rather than a
 * limit.** The time and the source, out of the time, the source and the
 * difficulty ring. `row shows` in the compact sort panel is where that is
 * changed, and `columns.ts` is where the reasoning lives. Turning everything
 * off is legal and gives the title the whole row, which on a 390px phone is
 * worth about eighty pixels of title.
