/**
 * App shell.
 *
 * A fixed now-playing banner over one scrolling list, so the list keeps its own
 * scroll position and the phone address bar doesn't fight the page — and, from
 * `lg` up, a second pane beside the list holding whatever song is selected.
 *
 * **The two panes are the layout, not a widescreen decoration.** The list was
 * the entire app at every width, which meant a 27-inch monitor got the phone's
 * design with the columns pulled apart: eight columns of 4,168 rows and nothing
 * to do with the other half of the screen. Master-detail spends that width on
 * the thing the list cannot hold — the twenty per-instrument difficulties, the
 * charter, the source, the full untruncated title — and it does it without
 * inventing a second interaction, because selecting a song is the same gesture
 * on a phone, where the same component arrives as a sheet.
 *
 * **The other axis is height, and it is not a smaller version of this one.** A
 * phone held sideways is 844×390: wider than `md`, wider than the song table's
 * own threshold, and with a quarter of the height the same width implies. Every
 * rule that asked only how wide the window was therefore served it the desktop
 * answer — the toolbar, the nine-column table, the keyboard hints — and left
 * one song row underneath. The `short` family of variants in `index.css` is
 * where that is answered, and the shell's own share of it is three things: the
 * banner collapsing to one line, `<main>` clearing the display cutout for
 * everything inside it, and the helper bar going away on the one device that
 * has neither the height for it nor the keys it names.

       * true of the whole session rather than inside a card about one song.

       * Which is exactly why it stops at `md`. On a phone it was spending the
       * one screen region a thumb can comfortably reach on shortcuts the device
       * cannot produce; below `md` the filter bar takes that space and fills it
       * with controls, and the sound control rides in the detail sheet's header

       * not have. `COMPACT_CHROME_QUERY` is that case and only that case; a
       * short *desktop* window keeps the bar, because there the shortcuts are
       * real and this is where the sound control lives.
       *
       * The two right-hand items are one cluster and are spaced as one, closer
       * to each other than the bar's own 25px: they are both answers to "what
