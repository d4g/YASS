/**
 * "Is there a newer YASS than this one?"
 *
 * Asks GitHub's releases API and stops there. The button this backs opens the
 * releases page in the host's browser; nothing downloads, installs or restarts
 * itself. That is not a stub for an auto-updater — `electron-updater` cannot
 * update a Windows `portable` target at all, and its AppImage path needs a
 * `publish` provider and a `latest-linux.yml` in the release, which
 * `release.yml` does not produce. Replacing one file where you put it is the
 * whole promise of both formats, and a process that rewrote itself while a
 * room full of guests were browsing would be breaking it.
 *
 * `/releases/latest` rather than the tag list, because it skips drafts and
 * prereleases — which is exactly how this repo ships. A tag build leaves a
 * *draft* holding the binaries and a person publishes it by hand after running
 * them, so this can never offer a release whose notes are unwritten and whose
 * binaries nobody has launched. The same rule hides `v0.2.0`, which is a tag
 * with no release behind it.
 *
 * Manual only: no timer, no check at startup. The one other outbound request
 * this app makes is the ffmpeg download, which is also a button, and "YASS
 * talks to the internet when you ask it to" is worth keeping true. It also
 * keeps a host clear of GitHub's 60-an-hour limit for unauthenticated callers,
 * which is shared by everything else on their address.
