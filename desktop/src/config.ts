/**
 * Reading and writing configuration, from a process that isn't the server.
 *
 * There are two ways to reach the settings file and the rule for choosing is
 * "one writer at a time":
 *
 *   server up   → `PUT /api/settings` over loopback. The server writes the
 *                 file and applies the change live, so a guest already
 *                 browsing on their phone sees the new song list appear
 *                 without a reconnect.
 *   server down → write the file here, with the server's own
 *                 `saveStoredSettings`.
 *
 * The two are mutually exclusive by construction, so there is no lock to get
 * wrong — and both run the same `normalizeSettings`, because both are the
 * server's code. This module reuses those modules rather than reimplementing
 * validation; that is the whole reason the `@server/*` path alias exists.
